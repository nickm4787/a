The source file run_analysis.R combines the data in the following tables:

subject_test.txt
x_test.txt
y_test.txt
subject_train.txt
x_train.txt
y_train.txt

After combining the six above tables into one table of 10,299 observations, the code reshapes the data into a much smaller .txt file consisting of the average result for each combination of Subject ID and Activity Type. The resulting .txt file lists these 180 averages, making it much easier to review than the original list of individual observations.
